# Custom-Bottom-NavigationBar

In this Code we created a Custom Navigation Bar using flutter

In the BottomNavigationBar property over scaffold
I implemented a Row of elements in a Container
which were seperated in mainaxis as space between
which sets everything at an even distance and each
Icon is an IconButton where user can click and perform certain actions.

Thank you!
Happy Coding!
